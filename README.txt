# Bi-LSTM

The repository contains files from the project for the programming class: a classification problem, that i tried to solve with 
a Bilateral LSMTM, using Keras. The classification is on 43 united stated elected presidents and is done based on their
discourses, using W2V vectorized single sentences as input 
All written in python 3.6, it requires the following 
libraries to be installed:
             os
             re
             nltk
             random
             logging
             numpy 
             from glob
             gensim
             keras
             sklearn
             pandas_ml 
             matplotlib
            
The contained files are: the network script, the zip of the U.S. presidential speeches as well as the already prepared 
President - Year - sentence corpus.
This last two were scripted by Patrizio Bellan (patriziobellan86) for a previous project.
